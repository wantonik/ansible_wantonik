# 3b. Using the command-line ansible command, make sure you can execute the ping module against
# the inventory file that you created in step 3a.
# Use the '-i ./my-inventory' arguments to specify the inventory file to use.

MY SOLUTION:
(py27_venv)[wantonik@ip-172-30-0-209 class1]$ ansible localhost -i ./my_inventory.e3c, -m ping 
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
(py27_venv)[wantonik@ip-172-30-0-209 class1]$

PROBLEMS:
The above didnt work against 'local' group due to 3 issues:
1. my_inventory.e3b file was incorrect i.e.

1.1. I had typo:
I had ansible-connection instead of ansible_connection in there.

1.2 ansible_python_interpreter viariable was as 2nd line in the local group.
It should always be in the same line for 'localhost', otherwise Ansible
will treat this varialbe as 2nd entry for the local group.

2. I used ',' [comma] in my ansible-command above. Once removed I was able
to ping localhost and local group successfully:

(py27_venv)[wantonik@ip-172-30-0-209 class1]$ ansible local -i ./my_inventory.e3b -m ping
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
(py27_venv)[wantonik@ip-172-30-0-209 class1]$ ansible localhost -i ./my_inventory.e3b -m ping
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}

END/SOLVED
