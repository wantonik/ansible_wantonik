## Scripts has been done and all the excercised practiced.
## I had difficulties with making the snmp script i.e.
## I tried to use a list of IPs and another list of OIDs,
## and then wanted to form 'for' loop to iterate through them
## to pick up the right ID-OID pairs for each routers (rtr1/rtr2).
## I faced issues, where snmpwalk or snmpget expected string as IP address or OID.
## I failed to fix it.
