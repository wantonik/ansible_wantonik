Hi Kirk,
I completed this lesson and amended as per your suggestions.
If you have any suggestion on how I could improve it any further
, let me know.
I am having problems with nested for loops where I want to get specific lines,
or sometimes parent and child line. They all feed from one global variable (cisco_cfg).

thanks
Rgds
